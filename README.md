A System Tray app that provides a reminder to follow the 20/20/20 rule.

## Description
It's recommended to abide by the 20/20/20 rule when looking at a screen | or in other words: 

Every **20 minutes** take a break for **20 seconds** to look at something **20 feet** away. 
[More info here.](https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule)

When using similar apps I found I would frequently not notice the notification or sometimes just ignore it altogether. In an attempt to strike a balance between being annoying enough to grab the users attention and not blocking any functionality, when it's time to look away and let your eyes rest 20続 will fade the users screen in and out for the entire duration.

## Installation

```PowerShell
> git clone https://github.com/Tbruno25/twenty_cubed
# cd into the twenty_cubed directory 
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Double click 20続.pyw or execute
```Powershell
> python 20続.pyw
```
The app should now be launched in your System Tray. 

**Left clicking** the app icon will toggle it's current state:

![##009b2f](https://via.placeholder.com/15/009b2f/000000?text=+) Green is ***active***

![##9c0404](https://via.placeholder.com/15/9c0404/000000?text=+) Red is ***paused***

While active every 20 minutes the screen will alternate fading as a reminder to look away.
